Utility-first CSS is exception-first CSS.

If you are completely sold on adopting an utility-first approach (e.g. Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS) for your UI, I suggest you read these articles by Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell. Or, even better, open DevTools and see how little CSS there is on their sites.

They also cowrote this great book that you should definitely read. It stepped up my CSS game big time.

I like the format Axiom chose for its incident postmortems:

1. brief. You can read it in 2-3 minutes
2. **summary** section with a few bullet points: incident overview, investigation and mitigation efforts, resolution and follow-up
3. **timeline** section with UTC timestamps
4. **impact** section listing consequences for Axiom customers
5. **next steps** section

Here is an example:
